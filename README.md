## Overview
This package generates a set of uniform placeholder icons with size labels. It is designed to assist you in creating new Chrome/web extensions. The idea was inspired by an [old archived repository](https://github.com/jbrudvik/chrome-extension-icon-sizes) that stored pre-made image sizes. I turned the concept into a simple `npm` package that is modular and customizable.

## Requirements

- Node.js `16.2.0` to install globally (using `npx` is easier if you're using a new version of `node`.)
- `npm` or `yarn`

## Usage

- `npx dfx-icons` generates all sizes of the same color and outputs them to the assets/icons folder
- `npx dfx-icons --sizes 16 48 128 --random` generates only the specified sizes with random colors
  > You can also install globally with `npm i -g dfx-icons` and run `icons` from anywhere. Requires node 16.2.0 so `npx` method is recommended.

## Features

- Generates icons of various sizes
- Allows customization of icon sizes and colors
- Overlays the size of the icon on top of the icon to help with debugging
